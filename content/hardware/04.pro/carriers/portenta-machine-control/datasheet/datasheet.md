### Digital Input 
8 channels, each is a 680 kΩ and 100 kΩ resistor divider: a 0-24V input is scaled down to 0-3V. 

### Digital Output 
The digital output connector has a 24V IN pin which must be supplied with 24V DC. 

The 24V IN pin is not galvanically isolated: the input voltage must be referred to the same GND of the board. 

The supply voltage can be the same 24V which is powering the board. 

- 8 high side switches (2x **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1**), one for each channel Current limit
- Nominal value is 0.6A per channel. Due to internal **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1** circuit tolerances the real value can be higher, up to 0.9A. 
- The 12 channels behavior when the current limit is reached can be selected: 
  - **Latch**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and the co-respective channel enable pin must be toggled to activate it again. 
  - **Retry**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and re-connected after a short period of time. If the current limit is reached again the process repeats periodically.

### Digital Programmable 
The **digital programmable** connector has a 24V IN pin which must be supplied with 24V DC.

The 24V IN pin is not galvanically isolated: the input voltage must be referred to the same GND of the board. 

The supply voltage can be the same 24V which is powering the board. 

- 12 high side switches (3x **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1**), one for each channel

Current limit 
- Nominal value is 0.6A per channel. Due to internal **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1** circuit tolerances the real value can be higher, up to 0.9A. 
- The 12 channels behavior when the current limit is reached can be selected: 

  **Latch**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and the co-respective channel enable pin must be toggled to activate it again. 

  **Retry**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and re-connected after a short period of time. If the current limit is reached again the process repeats periodically. 

Internal inductive loads kick-back protection plus external 60V, 2A Schottky diode **PMEG6020ER,115**

- 12 digital input channels, each is a 680kΩ and 100kΩ resistor divider: a 0-24V input is scaled down to 0-3V. 

  The digital input channels are independent of the high side switches.
  **The digital input channels can read the status of the high side switches if needed.**


### Analog Input 
The internal A/D converter of the microcontroller has a resolution of max 16 bit (12-16 bit range) and delivers values from 0 to 65535, configurable by the user via sketch. 

Three independent analog input channels are available. Each of them has an analog switch TS12A44514PWR which is switching between three modes: 

- **0-10V**
The input is connected to a 100kΩ and 39kΩ resistor divider: a 0-10V input is scaled down to 0-2.8V.  
Input impedance approximately 28kΩ 

- **4-20mA**
The input is connected to a 120Ω resistor. A 4-20mA current input becomes a 0.48V-2.4V voltage  

- **NTC**
The input is connected to a 3V voltage reference (REF3330AIRSER) with a 100kΩ resistor in series, becoming part of a resistor divider powered by the voltage reference.  

An output pin provides 24V to power sensors. A 500mA PTC resettable fuse protects the 24V output pin. 

### Analog Output 
Four independent analog output channels are available. Each of them a double low pass filter and a high current op amp arranged in a non-inverting topology with gain 3.3.

![AnalogOutput](assets/MachineControlAnalogOutputScheme.png)

At each input of each channel a PWM from Portenta is provided filtered by a double low pass filter, obtaining a DC output with a small AC ripple. The signal is then fed to the channel non inverting amplifier which amplifies it by 3.3. 

The output signal is a DC which amplitude is a function of the PWM duty cycle. 

Maximum output current is 20mA per channel. 

### Temperature Measurements 
Three independent temperature measurement channels are available. 

Each channel can measure non grounded thermocouples **OR** PT100, but cannot measure them at the same time.

**NOTE**: do not connect both a thermocouple and a PT100 to one channel. 
Only a single channel at a time is available to be read, according to the analog switches position. 

### Front-Ends 
There are two front ends on this board:

- MAX31855KASA+T dedicated to thermocouples
- MAX31865ATP+T dedicated to PT100

The front ends are multiplexed to the three channels via: 

  - A single low-ohmic single-pole double-throw analog switch NX3L4053HR,115 which is switching between one front end or the other. 
  - Three quadruple single pole single throw analog switches TMUX1511RSVR which are switching the active channel between the three available. 

### Connect Thermocouples 

**NOTE**: Connect only **non-grounded** thermocouples. (Grounded thermocouples are not supported).

**NOTE**: Do not connect both a thermocouple and a PT100 to a channel.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed. 

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration 
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas. 

## FCC Caution
Any Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: 

(1) This device may not cause harmful interference

 (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.
